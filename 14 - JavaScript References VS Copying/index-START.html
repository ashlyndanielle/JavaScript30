    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // unlike numbers, strings and booleans, it makes a reference
    // instead of a copy

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain2 = {...person};
    captain2['position'] = 'forward';
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
